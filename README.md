we do these homework by p controller first.
we get the error of y,x and rotation and by a feedback we pass desired position.
Both angular and linear velocities are controlled by controllers.
The P controller has low speed and accuracy because its speed decreases as the robot approaches the desired state.
The integrator is used to improve the accuracy and the derivative is used to improve the speed of reaching the desired state.
Due to the derivative property in increasing noise, a filter has been used next to it.
